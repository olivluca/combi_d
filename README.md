# Combi D experiments

Some experiments to emulate a cp-plus for a truma combi D (old version, with the rectangular cowl).

The *protocol* directory contains a description of the communication protocol on the lin
bus.

The *tester* directory contains a pascal program to check the protocol.

The *trumasim* directory contains a simple truma simulator (so I can check
my software when I'm not near my van).

The *trumalogger* directory contains a simple logger to capture lin frames
and save them in a file.

## cp plus emulator and display

See the [TruMinus](https://github.com/olivluca/TruMinus) for a cp plus emulator and [TrumaDisplay](https://github.com/olivluca/TrumaDisplay) for a display.
